The goal is to analyze open ports, services, and security configurations, apply changes, and compare results. By conducting multiple scans and modifying security settings, we aim to understand how different configurations impact network exposure.\n",

    "1Ô∏è‚É£ Run an initial Nmap scan (firewall enabled) to establish a baseline of open ports and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "2Ô∏è‚É£ Disable the firewall and conduct a comparative scan to observe what new services and ports become visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "3Ô∏è‚É£ Perform a stealth scan to analyze how the MacBook responds to more discreet scanning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "4Ô∏è‚É£ Manually disable unnecessary services (VNC, file sharing, remote access) to assess their impact on network exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "5Ô∏è‚É£ Re-enable the firewall to restore protection after disabling unneeded services.\n",

This discrepancy is likely due to Nmap‚Äôs OS fingerprinting relying on network behavior rather than directly querying the system. If Apple has maintained similar network stack characteristics between Monterey and Sonoma, Nmap may default to the closest known match in its database.

    "In our initial scans, several macOS sharing services were enabled, yet they did not appear in the Nmap results. One possible explanation is that the macOS firewall is actively blocking or filtering incoming connection attempts, preventing Nmap from detecting open ports. macOS has a built-in firewall designed to enhance security by limiting unauthorized network access. By default, it may block certain services even if they are enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test this hypothesis, we will temporarily disable the firewall and run the same Nmap scan again. If additional open ports appear in the results, this confirms that the firewall was actively restricting visibility. If the results remain the same, it suggests that those services may not be actively listening on a detectable port. After completing the test, we will re-enable the firewall to maintain security. This step will allow us to better understand how the firewall influences network scanning and service exposure on macOS.\n",

    "\n",
    "After disabling the firewall and running a scan that revealed many open ports and active services, we proceeded to re-enable the firewall without making any other changes. We then ran a third scan to measure its impact. The results showed a significant reduction in detected open ports, confirming that the firewall was once again filtering incoming connection attempts. However, since all services remained enabled, we expected some essential ports to remain open for system functionality. This scan reinforced our earlier findings that the firewall plays a crucial role in obscuring services from external probes. Our next step is to disable unnecessary services and perform a final scan to evaluate how reducing the attack surface affects system visibility and security.\n",

    "**Summary of Third Scan (Firewall Enabled, Unnecessary Services Disabled)**\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage of the project, we conducted a third scan after re-enabling the firewall while also manually disabling unnecessary services and remote access settings. This scan aimed to determine how effectively these changes reduced the system‚Äôs attack surface while still allowing essential functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Findings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Open ports were significantly reduced compared to the previous scan where the firewall was disabled.\n",
    "SSH (Port 22) remained open, which is expected as it was not manually disabled.\n",
    "AirTunes-related ports (5000/tcp & 7000/tcp) were still detected, likely due to macOS system-level services.\n",
    "Apple Remote Desktop (VNC - Port 5900) persisted, despite previous attempts to disable it in System Settings.\n",
    "Port 58807 (HTTP service) remained active, possibly related to system management services.\n",
    "Unknown high port (50958) continued to be detected, warranting further investigation with lsof.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results confirm that the firewall is actively filtering connections, allowing only explicitly permitted services to respond. However, certain services may still be running in the background despite being disabled in System Settings, highlighting the need for deeper system analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Step: Stealth Scanning**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have tested security settings under standard scanning conditions, we will proceed with stealth scanning techniques to determine how well the system evades detection by more sophisticated scanning methods. The goal is to evaluate whether stealth scans can bypass firewall protections and detect services that were previously obscured.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to perform a stealth scan using an SYN scan (-sS). This scan type is less detectable by firewalls and intrusion detection systems because it does not complete the full TCP handshake.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Command for Stealth Scan:**\n",
    "\n",
    "sudo nmap -sS -Pn -T4 192.168.1.148\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation of Parameters:**\n",
    "sudo ‚Üí Required for privileged scanning (raw packets).\n",
    "nmap ‚Üí Calls the Nmap tool.\n",
    "-sS ‚Üí SYN scan (Stealth Scan), sends SYN packets without completing a full connection.\n",
    "-Pn ‚Üí Treats the target as online (skips ICMP ping check, useful if firewall blocks pings).\n",
    "-T4 ‚Üí Sets a faster scan timing template.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "Determine if services that were hidden in previous scans can be detected.\n",
    "Test whether stealth scanning techniques bypass firewall filtering.\n",
    "Compare results with previous scans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next Steps After Running the Scan:\n",
    "Send the scan output.\n",
    "We will analyze the results.\n",
    "Compare findings with previous scans.\n",
    "Determine whether the stealth scan was able to bypass firewall protections."

    "**Summary of Final Stealth Scan & Key Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we conducted a series of structured Nmap scans to assess the impact of macOS firewall settings on system visibility and security. The final scan, a stealth scan (-sS -Pn -T4), revealed only two open ports, significantly reducing the exposed attack surface compared to previous scans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Command Used: sudo nmap -sS -Pn -T4 192.168.1.148\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results:**\n",
    "Two open ports detected:\n",
    "5000/tcp ‚Üí UPnP (Universal Plug and Play)\n",
    "7000/tcp ‚Üí afs3-fileserver (Andrew File System service)\n",
    "998 ports explicitly rejected connections (reset state), indicating that the firewall successfully blocked most probes.\n",
    "Previously detected services (SSH, VNC, AirTunes, unknown services) were no longer visible.\n",
    "Stealth scanning techniques did not retrieve OS details, service versions, or script-based information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Interpretation**\n",
    "The results confirmed that the macOS firewall effectively reduces system visibility in network scans. The stealth scan, which does not complete full TCP handshakes, was unable to detect most services, reinforcing the importance of firewall rules in preventing unauthorized reconnaissance.\n",
    "The only detected services (UPnP and AFS3) should be reviewed for necessity.\n",
    "Compared to full scans, the stealth scan demonstrated a significant decrease in system exposure.\n",
    "Firewalls, along with service management, play a critical role in security hardening.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison: How Security Measures Reduced Attack Surface**\n",
    "Scan Type\tFirewall State\tPorts Detected\tNotable Observations\n",
    "Baseline Full Scan (-A, -p-)\tEnabled\t7+ open ports\tSome services visible despite firewall\n",
    "Full Scan After Disabling Firewall (-A, -p-)\tDisabled\t7+ open ports\tMore services exposed, proving firewall effectiveness\n",
    "Stealth Scan (-sS -Pn -T4)\tEnabled\t2 open ports\tMajority of services hidden; stealth scan was largely ineffective\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Security Adjustments**\n",
    "\n",
    "To finalize system hardening and ensure minimal exposure, the following steps should be taken:Investigate Remaining Open Ports (5000 & 7000)\n",
    "Running: sudo lsof -i :5000 and sudo lsof -i :7000\n",
    "Determine if these services are necessary or should be disabled.\n",
    "Ensure the Firewall Remains Enabled\n",
    "\n",
    "The macOS firewall was proven effective in blocking unauthorized scanning attempts.\n",
    "Keeping it enabled is critical for ongoing security.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was conducted to assess the security posture of a MacBook Air by leveraging Nmap scanning techniques. The goal was to analyze how different security configurations impact network visibility and exposure. By performing multiple scans under varying conditions, we were able to observe the role of macOS firewall settings, remote services, and stealth scanning techniques in system security.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Phases & Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "1Ô∏è‚É£ Baseline Scan (Firewall Enabled, All Services Enabled)\n",
    "Objective: Identify open ports and services while the firewall was enabled.\n",
    "Findings:\n",
    "Fewer ports were detected than expected.\n",
    "The firewall actively blocked Nmap‚Äôs ability to see some services.\n",
    "OS detection reported macOS 12 Monterey, despite the system running macOS Sonoma 14.6.1, highlighting limitations in network fingerprinting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2Ô∏è‚É£ Firewall Disabled Scan (All Services Still Enabled)\n",
    "Objective: Determine the firewall‚Äôs impact by running the scan again with the firewall turned off.\n",
    "Findings:\n",
    "Additional ports and services were revealed, confirming the firewall‚Äôs role in filtering traffic.\n",
    "Services such as SSH (22), AirTunes (5000, 7000), and VNC (5900) became visible.\n",
    "SMB and NetAssistant services appeared, further expanding the attack surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "3Ô∏è‚É£ Re-Enabling Firewall While Keeping Services Active\n",
    "Objective: See if the firewall‚Äôs protection would once again obscure certain services.\n",
    "Findings:\n",
    "The firewall successfully hid many ports again.\n",
    "However, some services (AirTunes, VNC) remained detectable, likely due to their specific configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4Ô∏è‚É£ Stealth Scan with Nmap SYN Scan (-sS -Pn -T4)\n",
    "Objective: Test how stealth scanning techniques impact visibility.\n",
    "Findings:\n",
    "Stealth scanning revealed only two open ports (5000 and 7000) instead of the broader set detected in previous scans.\n",
    "This indicates that macOS firewall settings and TCP handshake behavior limit visibility to more subtle scan types.\n",
    "A stealth scan would likely bypass simple intrusion detection systems (IDS) that only log full TCP connections.\n",
    "Conclusion & Takeaways\n",
    "macOS Firewall is highly effective at reducing network exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the firewall on, many services remained hidden from external scans.\n",
    "When disabled, additional services were immediately detected.\n",
    "Nmap OS fingerprinting is not always accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "macOS was misidentified as Monterey 12 instead of Sonoma 14.6.1, due to how Apple implements network stack responses.\n",
    "Stealth scanning techniques significantly reduce detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "A SYN scan (-sS) identified only two ports, showing that even when services are open, certain scans might not detect them.\n",
    "The attack surface can be minimized by disabling unnecessary services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features like AirTunes, VNC, and SSH expose remote access points.\n",
    "If remote access is not needed, these services should be disabled for better security.\n",
    "Final Thoughts\n",
    "This project demonstrated how Nmap can be used to analyze a system‚Äôs security posture under different configurations.\n",
    "By systematically modifying security settings and observing the results, we gained insight into:\n",
    "\n",
    "The effectiveness of the firewall in blocking connections.\n",
    "The impact of stealth scanning in network reconnaissance.\n",
    "How open services contribute to potential attack surfaces.\n",
    "While this project focused on local network scanning, similar techniques can be applied to larger-scale cybersecurity assessments, including penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and enterprise security auditing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggested Next Steps (For Future Exploration): ‚úÖ Investigate Nmap scripting engine (NSE) for vulnerability scanning.\n",
    "‚úÖ Experiment with IPv6 scanning techniques (nmap -6).\n",
    "‚úÖ Use a packet analyzer (Wireshark) to monitor network traffic while scanning.\n",
    "‚úÖ Automate periodic scans with Python for continuous monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Complete üéØ**\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment successfully mapped the attack surface, tested firewall effectiveness, and analyzed scan evasion techniques.\n",
    "By applying these findings, security posture can be significantly improved through firewall enforcement, service minimization, and stealth detection awareness.\n",
